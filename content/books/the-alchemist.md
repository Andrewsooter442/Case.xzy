I love the ambiance of this book (I have read it twice!!).

I think people who read it with a preconcived connotation of *"destiny"* and *"free-will"* miss out on the more central theme, which in my opinion, is not about *"You not having free-will and a fixed destiny which you must fulfill like a chore"* but more about doing something **BY YOUR FREE WILL** which could be the purpose of our life and the most important thing to you.
