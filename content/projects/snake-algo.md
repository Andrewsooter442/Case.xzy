I made this project a while back after getting inspiration from a video from AlphaPhoenix.

(Everything above this line is the summary. Everything below is the "Hidden" detail).

The path-finding algorithm is not that complex; to be honest, the snake always follows a Hamiltonian path, and whenever it can cut the board in such a way that it can return to the original Hamiltonian path, it will cut the board and save some moves.

However, the rendering of the snake uses logic so complex that I could have solved world hunger if I was not writing it. made this project a while back after getting inspiration from a video from AlphaPhoenix.
