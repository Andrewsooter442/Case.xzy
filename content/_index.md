## <span style="color: #FFBF00; text-decoration: underline"> Hi, I am Shashank </span>

Welcome to my personal website. Here I mostly post about things that I am working on or find very interesting and want to show.
However I might post about *"full-flow staged-combustion engines"* or a rant on *"the bad architecture of my dorm"*.

I like writing programs as a means to an end of doing things that I find interesting. I also enjoy tinkering with electronics and computers, reading books, nerding out about cool things with my friends, and making them listen to my schizo rants.
I got into programming in my freshman year of high school when a friend of mine showed me a Monte Carlo simulation to prove a point.I started using Linux because I had a crappy i5 3rd-gen U-series CPU with 4 GB of RAM, and it couldn’t run Windows 11.
