The quadratic formula is:


``` bash
int main(){
    cout<<test"al";
}
```

$$
E = mc^2
$$

```python
import os
print("Anarchy rules")
```

\[
\begin{aligned}
KL(\hat{y} || y) &= \sum_{c=1}^{M}\hat{y}_c \log{\frac{\hat{y}_c}{y_c}} \\
JS(\hat{y} || y) &= \frac{1}{2}(KL(y||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}) + KL(\hat{y}||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}))
\end{aligned}
\]

Everyone should have a website where they can show their inner anarchy free of censorship and run it on-prem.

Also, All software should be free because [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) does not Glow, oh and the answer IS a hut in the woods.

\[
\begin{aligned}
KL(\hat{y} || y) &= \sum_{c=1}^{M}\hat{y}_c \log{\frac{\hat{y}_c}{y_c}} \\
JS(\hat{y} || y) &= \frac{1}{2}(KL(y||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}) + KL(\hat{y}||\frac{y+\hat{y}}{2}))
\end{aligned}

This is an inline \(a^*=x-b^*\) equation.

These are block equations:

\[a^*=x-b^*\]

\[ a^*=x-b^* \]

\[
a^*=x-b^*
\]

These are also block equations:

$$a^*=x-b^*$$

$$ a^*=x-b^* $$

$$
a^*=x-b^*
$$
