&lt;p&gt;This project is probably the one I’m most proud of. It’s not the most complex one, but I created it all in one day from scratch, and everything worked. The only bummer is that the judges couldn’t run it (wasn&amp;rsquo;t a one click go).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Prey-Predator Simulation</title><link>https://summer.xyz/projects/prey-predator/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://summer.xyz/projects/prey-predator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I made this project as part of WOC organized by SDSLabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a Python-based simulation where you can tweak the initial conditions and other parameters of an environment and then prey-predator adapt to each other and try to survive for a long time. (You are not playing GOD!)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Snake Playing Algorithm</title><link>https://summer.xyz/projects/snake-algo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://summer.xyz/projects/snake-algo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I made this project a while back after getting inspiration from a video from AlphaPhoenix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Everything above this line is the summary. Everything below is the &amp;ldquo;Hidden&amp;rdquo; detail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path-finding algorithm is not that complex; to be honest, the snake always follows a Hamiltonian path, and whenever it can cut the board in such a way that it can return to the original Hamiltonian path, it will cut the board and save some moves.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
